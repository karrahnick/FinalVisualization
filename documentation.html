                <p class="desc"> After taking some time to interpret the dataset that I chose, it was apparent from the beginning that attempting to include every bit of information into my visualization would be too overwhelming, resulting in a visualization that is not clear, simple, or easy to understand. My dataset includes statistics on the top 158 happiest countries in the world. However, given this high number and the many attributes included that contribute to how each country gained its ranking, I knew that I wanted to minimize this plethora of information so that my visualization can be easily interpreted without confusion. I began by asking myself what it is exactly that I wanted to portray by designing this visualization. I quickly came to the conclusion that I wanted people to look at my design and be able to answer these following questions: What are the top ranked happiest countries in the world? And why?   </p>
                <p class="desc"> Initially, I thought that the best way to display this information was by creating a visualization of multiple pie charts. I believed that by doing so, I would be able to place the countries in order of happiness rankings, each pie chart representing a different country. Each pie chart would then be broken down into the different categories that make up their rankings. I thought that this would clearly separate the countries from one another, allowing for an easy interpretation of the statistics of each of them. </p>

              <div class="title-desc">
                <p class="desc"> However, once I began to sketch this idea, I ran into a number of different problems. For starters, I had not yet decided on how many countries that I wanted to include in my data. But after beginning to sketch out my idea, I quickly realized that trying to pack in information for any more than the top 10 countries was going to be way too much, and would only hurt me by making it more confusing. Additionally, because the majority of my attributes are measured on different types of scales, it became apparent to me that a pie chart was not going to be the most accurate representation of my data because there is no simple way to divide the pie charts into accurately sized proportions.  </p>

            <div class="title-desc">
                <p class="desc"> After coming to this conclusion, I realized that I needed to come up with some sort of chart that accurately allows me to compare each of the different attributes for each of the countries separately. I knew then that my visualization would need to be very interactive so that you are able to flip through each of the different attributes without being overwhelmed by all of the information at once. I once again began to sketch out ideas for how I may want to do this, and quickly came to realize that my sketches looked most like an election donut type of visualization. </p>

            <div class="title-desc">
                <p class="desc"> Once I was able to piece together what type of chart would accurately represent my information, I was able to begin making the more specific design decisions. I decided that the best way to flip through the different attributes would be to have a key box at the top of my visualization, allowing for viewers to select exactly which category it is that they are wanting to compare. Once a category is selected, the election donut would then change to accurately represent the numbers assigned to each country. In addition to this, the sizing of each section would change to precisely compare those numbers to the other competing countries. In terms of deciding what color I would use to represent each of the countries, I felt as though my leading factor was wanting the chart to flow smoothly. Because the election donut flows from left to right in almost the shape of a rainbow, I decided that a gradual change in color in rainbow order would flow smoothly as well as be appealing to the eye. </p>
